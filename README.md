# Randomization and Approximation in Machine Learning
## Math 76.01, Mathematics in AI Final Project (Warren Shepard, Sri Korandla, Tushar Aaggarwal)

### Project Summary:

### Links to Data Sets:
MNIST data set used for Neural nets notebook, and the graph based supervised learning. We used the handwritten digits, and the fashion data set.
Other data sets used were synthetically created by us for the approximate knn and graph based learning sections.

### Links to Relevant Research Paper(s) used for Inspiration:

Paper by Li et al on randomized pruning for masking: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13183
Paper by Li et al on Pruning on language models: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13191
(Inspired by the Randomized Pruning, which we showed could be useful in small models)

Paper by https://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v008a014 inspired us to use pynndescent for our implementation of Approximate nearest neighbors
